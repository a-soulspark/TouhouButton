# Touhou Button
![icon](https://github.com/a-soulspark/TouhouButton/blob/main/icon.png)<br>
It's a button for a launcher, for Touhou.

Opens up a launcher that (really) briefly introduces you to the game.
Also comes with a neat (and WIP) social bar, because who doesn't love socializing?<br>
<sup>I certainly don't, so I made that social bar so I don't have to socialize IRL</sup>
